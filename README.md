# Vehicle Detection
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles
in a video (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full
project_video.mp4), but the main output or product we want you to create is a
[detailed writeup](writeup.md) of the project.

## Usage
This project depends on the
[term 1 starter kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit).

To run the training, start `python train.py`.

To run the pipeline, start `python run.py`.

Both files contain steering variables to generate the images used in the
[writeup](writeup.md).
